# TeamFalcon

The 'master' branch contains our hacker-rank clone
the 'second' branch contains our first hackathon project

Some notes about the hacker-rank clone:
  1. User's can only edit the title of the post. This means 
  they can not change the link of the post.
  2. There is downvoting, which just gets rid of the like.
  3. If the arrow is up, then that means it is not liked, 
  and if the arrow is down, then that means it is liked.
